This report discusses the extraction of BPMN process models from unstructured textual descriptions by explaining the inherent problems and presenting three distinct approaches to the task. These approaches, leveraging the natural language understanding capabilities of large language models, are evaluated for their ability to create a specific format of BPMN diagram from text-based data. The findings show that the ``Direct Translation'' and ``Intermediate Graph Representation'' approaches present significant challenges and limitations. Contrarily, the ``\nameref*{sec:traces}'' approach proves noteworthy, successfully solving the essential problems of the task while also being easy to implement and offering scope for further development. It therefore is an effective proposition for developing a proof-of-concept.
