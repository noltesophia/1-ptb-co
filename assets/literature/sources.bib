  abstract  = {Business process modeling has become an important tool for managing organizational change and for capturing requirements of software. A central problem in this area is the fact that the acquisition of as-is models consumes up to 60{\%} of the time spent on process management projects. This is paradox as there are often extensive documentations available in companies, but not in a ready-to-use format. In this paper, we tackle this problem based on an automatic approach to generate BPMN models from natural language text. We combine existing tools from natural language processing in an innovative way and augmented them with a suitable anaphora resolution mechanism. The evaluation of our technique shows that for a set of 47 text-model pairs from industry and textbooks, we are able to generate on average 77{\%} of the models correctly.},

  abstract  = {Business Process Modeling Languages (BPML's) are continuously getting attraction of software development communities due to the fact of specifying complex business requirements with simplicity. However, the development of business process models from textual requirements through existing BPML's is a time consuming task. In this context, Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques are commonly applied to automatically generate business process models from textual requirements. Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) is a well-known BPML. This article comprehensively investigates modern techniques, tools and trends for the generation of BPMN models from textual requirements by utilizing NLP techniques. Particularly, a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) is performed to select and evaluate 36 research studies published in the span of 2010--2018. As a result, 11 NLP and 8 BPMN tools are identified. Furthermore, 8 commonly generated BPMN constructs are recognized. Finally, a comparative analysis of NLP and BPMN tools is performed with the help of important evaluation parameters. It is concluded that the existing NLP techniques and tools significantly simplify the process of BPMN models generation from textual requirements. However, the existing approaches are inadequate to be applied in the industries, especially for real-time systems.},

  abstract  = {Models are compared to identify which elements are unchanged and which were added, removed, or modified. This information is necessary for developers to understand which edit steps were applied between two revisions of a model, to discover differences in concurrently developed models and it is also a fundamental building block for advanced processing steps, e.g. model merging. Hence, model comparison is generally considered as a critical factor for the acceptance and success of model-driven development approaches. Surprisingly however, for many model types only inadequate tool support for comparing models is available. This paper presents the prototype of a similarity-based model comparison tool for BPMN2 diagrams. The algorithms and heuristics of the SiDiff model differencing framework have been configured to the specific characteristics of BPMN2 diagrams. An initial evaluation indicates that the presented prototype produces results of high quality.},

  abstract  = {Conformance checking is a set of process mining functions that compare process instances with a given process model. It identifies deviations between the process instances' actual behaviour ("as-is") and its modelled behaviour ("to-be"). Especially in the context of analyzing compliance in organizations, it is currently gaining momentum - e.g. for auditors. Researchers have proposed a variety of conformance checking techniques that are geared towards certain process model notations or specific applications such as process model evaluation. This article reviews a set of conformance checking techniques described in 37 scholarly publications. It classifies the techniques along the dimensions "modelling language", "algorithm type", "quality metric", and "perspective" using a concept matrix so that the techniques can be better accessed by practitioners and researchers. The matrix highlights the dimensions where extant research concentrates and where blind spots exist. For instance, process miners use declarative process modelling languages often, but applications in conformance checking are rare. Likewise, process mining can investigate process roles or process metrics such as duration, but conformance checking techniques narrow on analyzing control-flow. Future research may construct techniques that support these neglected approaches to conformance checking.},

  abstract = {In the last decade, there has been a massive growth in the area of Business Process Management (BPM). As business processes become more complex, they generate a huge amount of data. The goal of BPM is to improve business processes' efficiency and reduce errors. At the heart of BPM is process mining, which is concerned with the analysis of process executions. A major goal of process mining is ensuring that a process is executed correctly by comparing a process model and an event log. This is known as off-line conformance checking. Previous work in conformance checking focuses on formal models such as Petri nets as opposed to visual business modeling languages used in practice, such as BPMN. Additionally, available techniques are computationally expensive and require much effort on the part of business analysts. Finally, such work tends to ignore temporal and organizational constraints. e.g. concerning resource availability. In this thesis, a multi-perspective online conformance checker for BPMN models is presented. The proposed conformance checker is able to validate process in terms of control-flow, temporal and organizational rules. This is performed through two main steps. Firstly, BPMN models are formalized through conversions to Petri nets, and Control-Flow rules are extracted from the generated Petri nets. These rules are then augmented with additional constraints specified by the BPMN models. The second step is to check the generated rules against an event log to evaluate its conformance while it is being generated. We achieve this by adapting the architecture of Snort, a popular Intrusion Detection System. The proposed framework is validated through experiments on both real and synthetic datasets. Additionally, the framework is compared to existing tools for conformance checking. The experiments show that the framework is able to detect violations accurately and efficiently.}

  abstract  = {Business Process Management is concerned with process-related artefacts such as informal specifications, formal models, and event logs. Often, these process-related artefacts may be affected by ambiguity, which may lead to misunderstandings, modelling errors, non-conformance, and incorrect interpretations. To date, a comprehensive and systematic analysis of ambiguity in process-related artefacts is still missing. Here, following a systematic development process with strict adherence to established guidelines, we propose a taxonomy of ambiguity, identifying a set of concrete ambiguity types related to these process-related artefacts. The proposed taxonomy and ambiguity types help to detect the presence of ambiguity in process-related artefacts, paving the road for improved processes. We validate the taxonomy with external process experts.},
